# Final-Project
"It's not gambling if you know you're going to win." 
I look into the history of gambling data in the NFL from 1979-2017 from profootballreference.com and repole.com. Using factors like home team, team history, and weather, I dig into game results and how that compares to point spreads and over/under lines set by Vegas. I visually analyze the data and provide regression analysis.

Millions of dollars are laid on the line every week with Vegas sportsbooks. However, more often than not, the public will end up losing to the house. This makes sense, as the sportsbooks have to stay in business somehow. There are other rules in place that make it even harder to make money on the public side-- for example, even if a bet is won, the house will often take a cut from the original bet. The standard payout of a bet that is won is approximately 87% of the original wager. This means instead of being able to win 50% of your bets to break even, you must win just above 53% of your bets. I find a few cases that can be exploited for a positive expected payout over the 38 year period analyzed.

The first tool looks at over/under lines set and how they relate to weather temperature. I find that Vegas over-accounts for cold temperatures negatively affecting scoring. The next two tools look at a gambler's expected payouts when betting on or against specific teams. I identify teams that, if they follow their trends of the last 40 years, can be bet on/against for >5% returns on investment. In fact, if you had been following my advice since 1979, you would have outperformed 3 bluechip stocks from the time period going into 2017: Woolworth's, Toys R Us, and Lehman Brothers. If you only have 2 takeaways from this application, they should be: always bet the over when the temperature is under 50 degrees, and always bet against the Eagles when they're the underdog.
